This project contains scripts for generating maps showing which countries 
exchange weather-radar data. The way this is done is by shading such countries 
light green and labeling them.

The country labels are ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 ccTLD strings, which are two 
characters long. These are most popularly known as Internet top-level domain 
names. These labels have been read from the "Countries of the World" database, 
available as an ASCII file from OpenGeoCode.Org.

The phys_geo database provides centroid coordinates for each country. In some 
cases these coordinates have had to be modified manually to make sense in this 
application context. Phys_geo organizes country information by three-letter 
country code, which requires a mapping to ISO 3166-1 alpha-3. Some countries 
that exist in COW do not exist in phys_geo.

Country polygons are administrative level 0 as made available in the GADM 
collection. GADM shape files have been downloaded, and the adm0 files have been 
extracted and used in this project. If these shape files are made available in 
this project, it is by permission according to the GADM license.

One or more Regional Association maps are generated from a Python script each.

No installation is required; the scripts should run out of the box unless the 
GADM data have to be accessed separately and downloaded into a directory called 
gadm0.

Dependencies
A stock Python scientific stack with matplotlib and basemap.
